There is no theoretical reason that anything is hard to change about software.
If you pick any one aspect of software then you can make it easy to change,
but we donâ€™t know how to make everything easy to change.
Making something easy to change makes the overall system a little more complex,
and making everything easy to change makes the entire system very complex.
Complexity is what makes software hard to change. /Martin Fowler.
